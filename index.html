    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am brand new to coding. After spending five years in the Real Estate/Title Insurance realm, I decided to try
        something totally different and very much outside of my comfort zone. </p>
    <p> My desire to learn coding is because I would like to have a better handle on technology and to have a concrete
        skill set to market myself with. I also enjoy that coding allows me to express my creative side. </p>
